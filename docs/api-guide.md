# API Guide

LDK Server exposes a gRPC API over HTTP/2 with TLS. This guide covers transport, authentication,
and provides an index of all available RPCs. For field-level details on each request and response,
refer to the proto definitions, which are the canonical reference and include links to the
underlying LDK Node documentation.

## Transport

- **Protocol:** gRPC over HTTP/2 with TLS (self-signed by default)
- **Default address:** `127.0.0.1:3536`
- **Content-Type:** `application/grpc+proto`
- **Service name:** `api.LightningNode`
- **Full RPC path format:** `/api.LightningNode/<MethodName>`

### gRPC-Web

Browsers cannot read HTTP/2 trailers, so the same port also speaks
[gRPC-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md) in binary mode, over
HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. Send `content-type: application/grpc-web+proto` (or `application/grpc-web`);
the response uses the same content-type and carries its trailers as a final body frame (flag byte
`0x80`). Authentication is identical: the `x-auth` HMAC covers the same framed request body.

Responses allow any origin (`access-control-allow-origin: *`) and expose `grpc-status` and
`grpc-message`, and CORS preflights are answered. Requests are authorized by their HMAC signature,
not by cookies, so this grants nothing to a page without the API key. A browser must trust the
server's certificate: use a CA-signed one or put a reverse proxy in front. Text mode
(`application/grpc-web-text`) is not supported.

## Authentication

Every gRPC request must include an `x-auth` metadata header with an HMAC-SHA256 signature:

```
x-auth: HMAC <unix_timestamp>:<hmac_hex>
```

Where:

- `unix_timestamp` is the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch
- `hmac_hex` is the hex-encoded result of
  `HMAC-SHA256(api_key_bytes, timestamp_be_bytes || grpc_request_body_bytes)`
    - `api_key_bytes` is the API key string encoded as UTF-8 bytes
    - `timestamp_be_bytes` is the timestamp as a big-endian 8-byte unsigned integer
    - `grpc_request_body_bytes` is the raw gRPC request body sent over HTTP/2, including
      the 5-byte gRPC message frame

The server rejects requests where the timestamp differs from the server's clock by more than
**60 seconds**.

## TLS

The server auto-generates a self-signed ECDSA P-256 certificate on first startup, stored at
`<storage_dir>/tls.crt`. Clients must pin this certificate (not rely on system trust roots)
since it is self-signed.

For the Rust client library, pass the PEM contents to `LdkServerClient::new()`. For other
languages, configure your gRPC channel to trust the server's certificate file.

## Proto Definitions

The canonical API definitions live in `ldk-server-grpc/src/proto/`:

| File           | Contents                                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `api.proto`    | All RPC request/response messages and documentation |
| `types.proto`  | Shared types (Payment, Channel, Peer, etc.)         |
| `events.proto` | Event envelope and event types for streaming        |
| `error.proto`  | Error response definitions                          |

### Generating Client Stubs

Any standard `protoc` toolchain can generate clients from these proto files. The proto directory
path is `ldk-server-grpc/src/proto/`. For Rust specifically, the `ldk-server-client` crate
provides a ready-made async client.

## Error Model

Errors are returned as standard gRPC status codes:

| gRPC Code                 | Meaning                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` (3)    | Malformed request or invalid parameters                          |
| `FAILED_PRECONDITION` (9) | Lightning operation error (e.g., insufficient balance, no route) |
| `INTERNAL` (13)           | Server-side bug                                                  |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` (16)    | Missing or invalid `x-auth` header                               |

The `grpc-message` trailer contains a human-readable error description.

## Endpoint Reference

All RPCs are unary (single request, single response) unless noted otherwise.

### Node Information

| RPC           | Description                                                                                          |

> [!WARNING]
> `SubscribeEvents` is a best-effort stream of new events. Events are not persisted for
> subscribers, cannot be replayed after reconnecting, and have no client acknowledgement.
> Acceptance by the server's broadcast channel does not guarantee that a client received or
> processed an event.

Events are broadcast to all currently connected subscribers. The server uses a bounded broadcast
channel (capacity 1024), so a slow subscriber that falls behind will miss events. Disconnected
clients also miss events and receive only new events after reconnecting. If the server cannot read
data required to construct a payment event, it logs the error and skips that event so the event
queue can continue processing.

Use events as notifications. After reconnecting, reconcile recoverable state with APIs such as
`GetPaymentDetails`, `ListPayments`, `ListForwardedPayments`, and `ListChannels`. Some event fields
cannot be recovered through these APIs.

### Metrics

Metrics are served as a plain HTTP GET endpoint (not gRPC):

```
GET /metrics
```

Returns Prometheus-format text. Requires `[metrics] enabled = true` in the config. Supports
optional Basic Auth. See [Configuration](configuration.md#metrics) for setup.

## BOLT 12 Payer-Proof Lifecycle

Subscribe with `SubscribeEvents` before you send a BOLT 12 payment. Events are not replayed.

When `PaymentSuccessful` arrives, retain its `payment_id`, `payment_preimage`, and
`bolt12_invoice`. Pass these values to `Bolt12CreatePayerProof`. The request can also select the
optional invoice fields that the proof discloses. Payment history APIs cannot recover all the
inputs required to create a proof if this event is missed. Save these values before processing
other events.

The `bolt12_invoice` field is absent for static-invoice payments. These asynchronous payments
cannot produce payer proofs.

## Hodl Invoice Lifecycle

Hodl invoices allow you to inspect and conditionally accept incoming payments:

1. **Subscribe:** Call `SubscribeEvents` before you create or share the invoice. Events are not
   replayed.
2. **Create the invoice:** Generate a new payment hash. Call `Bolt11ReceiveForHash` with this hash.
   Never reuse a payment hash. Reuse is unsafe and can cause loss of funds.
3. **Handle each payment:** Save the payment ID from each `PaymentClaimable` event. A payer can pay
   the same invoice more than once. Each payment has a separate event and payment ID.
4. **Decide before `claim_deadline`:**
    - **Accept an expected payment:** Check the event's `claimable_amount_msat` against the amount
      you expect. Call `Bolt11ClaimForId` with its payment ID, preimage, and the event's claimable
      amount.
    - **Reject an unexpected payment:** Call `Bolt11FailForId` with its payment ID. Reject duplicate
      and late payments instead of ignoring or claiming them.

The claim request's optional amount is passed to LDK Node for a lower-bound check against its
stored payment amount, less any skimmed fee. It is not an exact amount check or a request to claim
that many millisatoshis. A larger supplied amount passes this check; omitting it skips the check.
Always validate the event's amount before you claim the payment.

The payment is held in a pending state until you claim it, fail it, or its `claim_deadline` is
reached. `PaymentClaimable` notifications are best-effort and are not replayed. If you miss the
event or do not act before the deadline, LDK Node automatically fails the HTLC backward and the
payment can no longer be claimed. Keep the subscriber healthy and resolve reported persistence
errors before accepting further payments.

## Pagination

`ListPayments`, `ListForwardedPayments`, `ListChannelForwardingStats`, and
`ListChannelPairForwardingStats` support cursor-based pagination:

1. Make the first request without a `page_token`. The server controls the page size.
2. If the response includes a `next_page_token`, pass it as `page_token` in the next request.
3. When `next_page_token` is absent, you have reached the end of the results.

The page token is one opaque string. Do not parse or modify it. Results are ordered by creation
time (most recent first).

The CLI `--number-of-payments` option combines multiple pages. It does not set the gRPC page size.
